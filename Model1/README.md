## Approach

#### Level 1 - Real vs. AI Detection:
- Objective: Distinguish real data from AI-generated content.
- Implementation: Use ResNET-50 as Image encoder.
- Fully connected layer added, with output size equal to two at this level, followed by a SoftMax activation.

#### Level 2 - GAN vs. DM Discrimination:
- Objective: Differentiate between images generated by GANs and DMs.
- Implementation: Again Use ResNET-50 as Image encoder.
- Fully connected layer added, with output size equal to two at this level, followed by a SoftMax activation.


#### Level 3 - Specific Architecture Recognition:
- Task: Identify the specific architecture within the dataset.
- Divided into two sub-modules:
    1. "Level 3-GANs": Creating 3-classes classifier using ResNET-50 as backbone for image encoding.
    2. "Level 3-DMs": Similarly creating
